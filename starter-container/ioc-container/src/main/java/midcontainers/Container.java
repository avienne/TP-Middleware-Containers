/**
 * Definition of a container interface.
 * <p/>
 * A container performs components assembly, also called "dependency injection".
 * It allows component bindings to be declared, with each binding consisting of
 * a key based on the interface + a string qualifier, an implementation and an
 * instance allocation policy.
 * <p/>
 * A container also allows the definition of arbitrary objects associated with
 * a name as a string.
 * <p/>
 * Component instantiation and dependency injection is performed through their
 * constructors. Constructors are iterated until the first one can be satisfied
 * with respect to its dependencies. You must thus be cautious regarding the
 * presence of implementations having several constructors, and especially
 * those having default / no-argument constructors.
 * <p/>
 * The special <code>@Named</code> annotation allows constructor parameters
 * to be given a qualifier. This is optional in the case of components, and
 * mandatory for defined values.
 * <p/>
 * Each constructor argument is first tried against a container-defined binding.
 * If none is found and the <code>@Named</code> annotation is present, a value
 * is looked up. If none is found, or the <code>@Named</code> annotation is
 * missing, the constructor is discarded. The process shall continue until no
 * suitable constructor exists to make an assembly.
 * <p/>
 * The following is an example of a component implementation definition with
 * the injection of an unqualified component and a defined value:
 * <p/>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * public class SomeEchoClient implements EchoClient {
 *     private final Echo echo;
 *     private final String message;
 *
 *     public SomeEchoClient(Echo echo, @Named("message") String message) {
 *         this.echo = echo;
 *         this.message = message;
 *     }
 *
 *     public String run() {
 *         return echo.echo(message);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * A sample usage would be similar to the following unit-test excerpt:
 * <p/>
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * Container container = new LocalContainer();
 * container
 *     .declare(new Binding(Echo.class, SomeEcho.class, null, NEW))
 *     .declare(new Binding(EchoClient.class, SomeEchoClient.class, null, NEW))
 *     .define("prefix", "[ ")
 *     .define("suffix", " ]")
 *     .define("message", "hello");
 *
 * EchoClient client = container.obtainReference(EchoClient.class);
 * assertThat(client.run(), is("[ hello ]"));
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Containers may also support delegation to other containers. When a
 * component or defined value cannot be obtained from a container,
 * it can forward the lookup to its delegates. The delegation mechanism
 * is read-only, that is, a container cannot declare bindings and values
 * to a delegate.
